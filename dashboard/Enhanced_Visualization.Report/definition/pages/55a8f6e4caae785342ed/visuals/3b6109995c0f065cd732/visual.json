Profit variability increases over time, particularly in Q4, indicating strong seasonality and higher business activity during year-end periods. Q1 and Q2 remain relatively stable with smaller spreads, while Q3 and Q4 show wider interquartile ranges and several outliers, reflecting both opportunities and risks in late-year performance. The presence of extreme outliers suggests the need for further investigation into exceptional transactions or data quality issues.",
